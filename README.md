# Showcase advanced Power BI capabilities to perform data visualization by creating a dashboard for the analysis of data professionals' demographics across multiple key countries globally.

Data Analysis Findings:
- The majority of individuals in the data industry hold titles such as data scientist, data engineer, data architect, and data analyst.
- Among the surveyed individuals, the most popular programming languages are Python, R, and Other (SQL), which are the primary tools in the data-related industry.
- The data industry is predominantly male-dominated, with males outnumbering females by approximately 2.5 times.
- Unfortunately, individuals in the data-related industry rated their satisfaction with salary and work-life balance relatively low, scoring 4.27 and 5.74, respectively, out of a maximum of 10 points. However, due to significant variations among the countries surveyed, such as higher work pressure faced by professionals in India compared to those in the United States and Canada.
- Different countries exhibit varying data demands across different industries. The United States demonstrates a relatively even distribution of industry demands, with income levels relatively stable. In contrast, Canada's real estate industry shows high demand for data, with professionals in this field earning the highest income.
- Interestingly, despite being developed countries, data professionals in the United Kingdom generally earn lower average incomes, only slightly higher than those in India. Considering the significantly higher cost of living in the UK compared to India, it can be concluded that the disposable income of data professionals in the UK is actually lower. Therefore, respondents from the UK also provided lower salary scores.
